- No critical or open bugs; security overdue 0.
- Team mood 10 (top of scale); coverage 85% at threshold.
- Consistent coverage and mood over the trend window.

## 🚨 What Needs Attention

- Sprint % volatility in the 4-sprint window (35% → 78% → 75%) — planning or scope changes may be driving swing; worth a brief retrospective to lock in the recent improvement.
- No other alerts at this time.

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

1. **Lock in delivery stability** — Keep commitment discipline that produced 78–75% in S102–S103; consider same target band for next sprint. Owner: Scrum Master / PM.
2. **Optional** — If volatility recurs, capture context in sprint title (e.g. dependency, holiday) for future report clarity.

## Data Quality

- All key metrics reported for last completed sprint; no exclusions.
- Trend based on last 4 completed sprints (S100–S103). S100/S101 had low Sprint %; no magnitude spike vs history, so no verify tag.
