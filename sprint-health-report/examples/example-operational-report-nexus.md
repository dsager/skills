## 👍 What's Going Well

- Delivery recovered: Sprint % 75% (in healthy band) after a low 35% in Sprint 99 and 38% in Sprint 101; last two sprints 78% and 75% show stabilisation.
- No critical or open bugs; security overdue 0.
- Team mood 10 (top of scale); coverage 85% at threshold.
- Consistent coverage and mood over the trend window.

## 🚨 What Needs Attention

- Sprint % volatility in the 4-sprint window (35% → 78% → 75%) — planning or scope changes may be driving swing; worth a brief retrospective to lock in the recent improvement.
- No other alerts at this time.

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

1. **Lock in delivery stability** — Keep commitment discipline that produced 78–75% in S102–S103; consider same target band for next sprint. Owner: Scrum Master / PM.
2. **Optional** — If volatility recurs, capture context in sprint title (e.g. dependency, holiday) for future report clarity.

## 💬 Slack Drafts

### Team Lead: [name]
> Hey [name], quick one on Nexus — delivery has stabilised nicely at 75–78% the last two sprints, which is great after the 35% dip in S99. Wanted to check: do you have a sense of what caused the swings earlier (scope changes, dependencies, capacity)? Would be good to capture that so we can flag it in future reports if it pops up again.

*(Product Owner and Agile Coach: no actionable topics this sprint — Nexus is in good shape.)*

## Data Quality

- All key metrics reported for last completed sprint; no exclusions.
- Trend based on last 4 completed sprints (S100–S103). S100/S101 had low Sprint %; no magnitude spike vs history, so no verify tag.
